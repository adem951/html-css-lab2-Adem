            <h2> Welcome to Our Amazing Spa</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to The Striped Umbrella — a full-service resort and spa just steps from the Gulf of Mexico and ten miles east
                of Crab Key, Florida. Come enjoy the best of both worlds, a secluded sandy beach populated with beautiful birds, yet a
                short drive down the road from world-class shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. Bring a good book and leave your
                laptop at the office. You won't want to go home.
            </p>
